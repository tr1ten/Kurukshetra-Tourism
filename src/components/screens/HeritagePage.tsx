          <div>
            A beautiful water tank in Kurukshetra, Brahma Sarovar, is dedicated to Lord Shiva. It is believed that Lord
            Brahma created the universe from this land. Just in the close vicinity of this sacred place are the Birla
            Gita Mandir and Baba Nath's 'haveli'. The Sarovar comes to life in winters when birds migrate from faraway
            places to take a dip in these waters. This beautiful xtank bears a shining look during the 'Deep Daan' and
            'Aarti' on the occasion of Gita Jayanti in the late November and early December.

          <div>
            Sthaneshwara Mahadev Temple is situated at Thanesar. There lies a story behind this temple that Pandavas
            prayed to Lord Shiva to receive his blessings for the victory in the battle of Mahabharata. So, the water of
            the tank adjoining the temple is believed to be holy. It is believed that Kurukshetra pilgrimage visit is
            incomplete without visiting this temple. The temple of Sthaneshwara was an important part of the kingdom of
            King Harsh Vardhana of Pushyabhuti dynasty.
